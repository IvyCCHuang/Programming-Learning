Instructor: Judy Richardson
## Course Objectives

In this course, we are going to focus on **three** learning objectives:

1. _Use the Modeling and Design Tool in MySQL Workbench._
   
2. _Generate a database from a model in MySQL Workbench._
   
3. _Import data into an existing database table in MySQL Workbench._
   

By the end of this course, you will be able to **use MySQL Workbench to draw a data model, and create a database from that model. In addition you will import data and write simple SQL queries to test the data model design.**

## Course Structure

### This course is divided into 3 parts:

1. Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
	
2. Create a Database with the Modeling Tool in MySQL Workbench: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
   
3. Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.
   

## Project Structure

The hands on project in **Create a Database with the Modeling Tool in MySQL Workbench** is divided into following tasks:

### Task 1: What does MySQL Workbench Do? 【解释术语、MySQL的界面】
