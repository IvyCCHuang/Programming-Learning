# Programming-Learning
 
 My notes in learning programming languages, including regular expressions, SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, Java...

Hello, I am Ivy. I graduated with a liberal arts major. I am pursuing a career in writing, translating, and perhaps programming (let's dream big!). 

As you can see, I enjoy expressing ideas via words and visual signs rather than talking with people face to face. Dealing with interpersonal relationships in the physical world is not my strength, but I still love to hear diverse ideas from all walks of life, so this virtual world is my heaven. 

I know how difficult it is to transfer from the liberal arts fields to others like social science, engineering, computer science, and so on. 

But the world needs us to change. And we have got to adapt its pace. Although we have to be optimistic about our master of AI, we still need to keep a sense of crisis that we may be replaced someday. The best weapon we have to combat and balance with them is our mindset, our thinking, our human minds. 

The better we understand computers, the better we can take advantage of them. Therefore, I create this repository to record my growth and share my knowledge. If you are interested in what I have done and have been doing, join me, contact me, share with me, or do anything you feel like the best to exchange ideas with me.

My initial learning path of programming languages: 
1. Regular Expressions: easy, can practice through regular searching
2. SQL: easier than Python
3. (optional) VBA: not sure if I continue or not, `Record Macro` is enough for me so far.
4. HTML5 & CSS3: keep learning for my transition into technical writing/translation (This is the best way to enter a science field for an LA major like me.)
5. (optional) JavaScript: see whether HTML & CSS needs further ability (if I am able to become a front-end engineer)
6. Python: for data processing and analysis, really useful for my daily life
7. Java: to learn in 2024, if I want to take the CS self-taught exams
8. C, C++: to learn if I want to take the CS postgraduate entrance exams
